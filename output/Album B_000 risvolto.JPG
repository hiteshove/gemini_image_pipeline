The main panel, likely made of thick paper or cardstock, has a slightly textured, matte finish. Handwritten in a light-colored chalk or crayon, the central text reads in Italian: 'ALBUM FOTOGRAFIE FAMIGLIA MARTINY.' (Photo Album Martiny Family.), followed by 'dal 1919 al 1926 -' (from 1919 to 1926 -), and then '- pi√π ritratti vari -' (more/mostly various portraits -). Two horizontal blue fabric ribbons are threaded through the reddish-brown cover, possibly as a decorative element or for securing the album. The edges of the album, visible on the left side and partially on the top and bottom, are covered with a faded blue patterned paper featuring a repeating white or light-colored floral motif. The overall condition of the album cover indicates its age, with visible wear and tear, including frayed edges on the patterned paper, suggesting a long history of use and handling.\",\n  \"tags\": [\n    \"photo album\",\n    \"vintage\",\n    \"family history\",\n    \"Martiny family\",\n    \"1910s\",\n    \"1920s\",\n    \"Italian\",\n    \"handwritten\",\n    \"historical document\",\n    \"memorabilia\",\n    \"brown\",\n    \"blue\",\n    \"textile\",\n    \"ribbon\",\n    \"portraits\",\n    \"ephemera\",\n    \"cover\"\n  ],\n  \"contextual_category\": \"Historical Documents and Ephemera\",\n  \"entities\": {\n    \"people\": [\n      {\n        \"name\": \"Martiny family\",\n        \"type\": \"Family\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"organizations\": [],\n    \"locations\": [],\n    \"date_estimate\": \"1919-1926\"\n  }\n}\n```"
