The photographs are held in place by small corner slits in the album page. Handwritten in white at the top center of the page are the words \\\"- CLAVIÈRES - 1923 -\\\". \\n\\nThe photographs, mostly octagonal or rectangular, depict various scenes of people engaging in winter activities, primarily skiing. The attire of the individuals suggests early 20th-century fashion, including wool knickers, simple coats, and hats. The skis appear to be long wooden models with basic bindings and poles. Many of the scenes take place in snowy, mountainous landscapes, some featuring sparse pine trees or forested areas.\\n\\nKey scenes captured include:\\n*   Groups of skiers, some appearing to be children or young adults, posing or moving on gentle slopes.\\n*   Two photographs show what appears to be an organized ski event or race, with individuals wearing bib numbers (e.g., '22', '41').\\n*   One photo includes a large building, possibly a hotel or lodge, in a snowy village setting, with skiers nearby.\\n*   Several photos show small groups of friends or family members on skis, some smiling at the camera.\\n*   One particularly charming photo features two young boys in ski gear, with a dog in the background.\\n\\nThe overall impression is one of early recreational skiing, capturing a sense of leisure and enjoyment of the winter landscape. The sepia tones of the black and white prints add to the vintage aesthetic.\",\n  \"tags\": [\n    \"vintage photography\",\n    \"photo album\",\n    \"Clavières\",\n    \"1923\",\n    \"skiing\",\n    \"winter sports\",\n    \"black and white\",\n    \"sepia tone\",\n    \"historical\",\n    \"mountain landscape\",\n    \"snow\",\n    \"group photos\",\n    \"children\",\n    \"adults\",\n    \"recreation\",\n    \"early 20th century\",\n    \"ski race\",\n    \"ski fashion\"\n  ],\n  \"contextual_category\": \"Historical Photography / Sports & Recreation\",\n  \"entities\": {\n    \"people\": [\n      \"skiers\",\n      \"children\",\n      \"adults\",\n      \"racers\"\n    ],\n    \"organizations\": [],\n    \"locations\": [\n      \"Clavières\"\n    ],\n    \"date_estimate\": \"1923\"\n  }\n}\n```"
