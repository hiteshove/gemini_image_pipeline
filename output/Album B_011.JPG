Hand-written in white at the top of the page are the words \\\"-COURMAYEUR - 1920-\\\", with \\\"- Estate -\\\" inscribed below, likely indicating a summer (Estate in Italian/French) visit. The page holds nine octagonal-shaped black and white photographs, meticulously arranged in three rows of three. The collection primarily documents a family's vacation in the Italian Alps, specifically Courmayeur, a renowned resort town. \\n\\nThe photographs offer a blend of scenic vistas and candid portraits. Several photos highlight the majestic, snow-capped peaks and glaciers of the Mont Blanc massif, which dominates the background in many shots. One striking landscape focuses on a large glacier, viewed from a distance, with trees in the foreground, and possibly two figures observing. Another landscape shows a valley village nestled amidst the mountains. \\n\\nFamily life is a central theme, with numerous images featuring children and women. There are two group portraits of young children, likely siblings or friends, dressed in period clothing and posing in grassy fields against the mountainous backdrop; one group consists of five children, with the girls wearing decorative bows in their hair. Other photos capture individual children or pairs, such as two children by an ornate metal gate, or a girl and a boy on a rustic stone staircase, with another child visible further up. Adult women, dressed in long skirts and blouses typical of the era, appear in several scenes, sometimes with children. One poignant image shows a woman and a young boy in a field of wildflowers, with a dramatic glacial landscape behind them, the boy holding a small bouquet. The overall impression is one of cherished memories from a summer holiday a century ago, celebrating both family and the grandeur of nature.\",\n  \"tags\": [\n    \"Vintage photography\",\n    \"Photo album\",\n    \"1920s\",\n    \"Courmayeur\",\n    \"Aosta Valley\",\n    \"Italian Alps\",\n    \"Mont Blanc\",\n    \"Glacier\",\n    \"Snow-capped mountains\",\n    \"Landscape\",\n    \"Family vacation\",\n    \"Children\",\n    \"Women\",\n    \"Summer holiday\",\n    \"Historic\",\n    \"Black and white\",\n    \"Mountain scenery\",\n    \"Leisure\",\n    \"Outdoor recreation\",\n    \"Alpine\",\n    \"Octagonal photos\"\n  ],\n  \"contextual_category\": \"Personal Archive / Travel Photography\",\n  \"entities\": {\n    \"people\": [\n      {\n        \"type\": \"group\",\n        \"description\": \"Multiple children (boys and girls) in various poses, suggesting siblings or friends on holiday.\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"type\": \"group\",\n        \"description\": \"Several women, likely adults from the family, seen with children or observing landscapes.\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"organizations\": [],\n    \"locations\": [\n      {\n        \"name\": \"Courmayeur\",\n        \"type\": \"town\",\n        \"country\": \"Italy\",\n        \"region\": \"Aosta Valley\",\n        \"features\": [\"Alpine resort\", \"Mont Blanc Massif\"]\n      },\n      {\n        \"name\": \"Mont Blanc Massif\",\n        \"type\": \"mountain range\",\n        \"country\": \"Italy/France\",\n        \"features\": [\"Snow-capped peaks\", \"Glaciers\"]\n      },\n      {\n        \"name\": \"Italian Alps\",\n        \"type\": \"geographic region\",\n        \"country\": \"Italy\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"date_estimate\": \"1920\"\n  }\n}\n```"
