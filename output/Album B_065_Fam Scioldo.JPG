Berra in Torino, Italy, circa 1890-1910.\",\n  \"detailed_description\": \"This black and white, formal studio portrait captures a large Italian family, composed of eleven individuals: two adult men, three adult women, and six children. The subjects are meticulously arranged in a multi-tiered pose, typical of late 19th to early 20th-century photography, against an ornate studio backdrop. The backdrop simulates a grand interior, featuring classical architectural elements such as fluted columns and elaborate scrollwork, possibly part of a fireplace or mantelpiece. A patterned rug covers the floor, adding to the illusion of an opulent setting.\\n\\nIn the back row, a balding man with a distinctive mustache stands centrally, dressed in a formal dark suit with a white shirt and tie. He is flanked by two women, both wearing dark, long-sleeved dresses characteristic of the period. The woman to his left (viewer's left) wears a high-necked garment, while the woman to his right (viewer's right) has a dark jacket over a patterned or striped blouse, with her hair styled in an updo.\\n\\nThe middle section of the portrait features an older boy on the far left, standing in a tweed-like jacket, light shirt, and tie. Next to him, a younger boy is partially visible, wearing a light-colored sailor-style tunic. A young girl, dressed in a white ruffled-sleeve dress, stands prominently in front of the central man. On the far right, another adult woman, also in a dark, long-sleeved dress with full, puffed shoulders, sits with a small child on her lap. Another small child, a boy, is cradled by the woman in the back row on the left.\\n\\nThree young girls occupy the front row, seated or kneeling. The girl on the far left is adorned in a long, white dress with delicate lace or pleated details. In the center, another girl wears a white tiered dress with ruffled shoulders. On the far right, the youngest girl sits directly facing the viewer, clad in a simple white dress with a ruffled collar.\\n\\nThe photograph is presented as a cabinet card, mounted on thick card stock. The bottom of the mount is embellished with a gold embossed crest on the left, the photographer's name \\\"G.B. Berra\\\" in elegant script in the center, and the location \\\"TORINO\\\" (Turin, Italy) on the right. The image shows some signs of age, including minor surface imperfections and slight wear on the mount's corners, adding to its historical charm.\",\n  \"tags\": [\n    \"family portrait\",\n    \"Italian family\",\n    \"Torino\",\n    \"Turin\",\n    \"G.B.
