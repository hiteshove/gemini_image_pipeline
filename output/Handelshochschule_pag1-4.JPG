The document is printed on off-white paper, which shows signs of significant aging, including yellowing, creasing, and minor tears, particularly along the fold and edges. The right page serves as an official attestation, featuring a formal heading: 'Der Senat der Handelshochschule zu Leipzig' (The Senate of the Business School in Leipzig). It certifies that 'Herr Walter Marling', born in 'Turin', was matriculated at the institution from '22. Oktober 1904' (October 22, 1904) until '28. Juli 1905' (July 28, 1905). The text further states that his conduct during this period was unblemished ('nichts Nachteiliges zur Anzeige gekommen ist') and that he accepted the lectures and commercial exercises listed. The certificate is dated 'Leipzig, den 28. Juli 1905' and bears a cursive signature over the title 'Vorsitzender' (Chairman), possibly 'G. Zewiniger'. A circular embossed or stamped seal from 'Handels-Hochschule Leipzig' featuring an allegorical figure (possibly Mercury or a similar emblem of commerce) is visible below the date. The bottom left corner of this page also contains handwritten archival or reference numbers like 'T. I. 11140 06' and 'A. G. 11.05'. The left page is a tabular section, likely intended for a detailed record of courses. It is divided into columns labeled 'Semester.', 'Benennung der Vorlesungen und kaufmännischen Übungen.' (Name of Lectures and Commercial Exercises.), and 'Docent.' (Lecturer.). This section is largely blank, with dotted lines for entries, suggesting it was either not filled out for this particular student or the complete record would have been on subsequent pages. Two visible punch holes or marks are present on the right edge of the left page, indicating it might have been part of a bound file.\",\n  \"tags\": [\n    \"academic certificate\",\n    \"transcript\",\n    \"university document\",\n    \"Handelshochschule Leipzig\",\n    \"business school\",\n    \"German\",\n    \"Leipzig\",\n    \"Walter Marling\",\n    \"1905\",\n    \"vintage\",\n    \"historical document\",\n    \"education\",\n    \"student record\",\n    \"early 20th century\",\n    \"matriculation\",\n    \"attestation\"\n  ],\n  \"contextual_category\": \"Historical Documents / Academic Records\",\n  \"entities\": {\n    \"people\": [\n      {\n        \"name\": \"Walter Marling\",\n        \"role\": \"Student\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"name\": \"G.
