The document is printed on off-white, aged paper, exhibiting several prominent fold lines, suggesting it was once folded for storage. Two small punch holes are visible at the top, likely for binding the document into a file. A small tear is also present on the right edge.\\n\\nThe certificate opens with the traditional German phrase \\\"Mit Gott!\\\" (With God!). It states that \\\"Herr Walter Martiny aus F端rth\\\" (Mr. Walter Martiny from F端rth) has been admitted on this day as a \\\"Studierender der Handelswissenschaften\\\" (student of Commercial Sciences). The admission was granted after he had promised by handshake to obey the Senate and the laws of the Commercial College.\\n\\nThe document is dated \\\"Leipzig, den 22. Okt. 1904.\\\" and bears a handwritten signature, which appears to be \\\"Prof. Dr. [Surname unclear, possibly Maydr or Mayer]\\\", identified by the title \\\"z. Z. Studiendirektor.\\\" (currently Director of Studies). A circular blue stamp of the \\\"Handels-Hochschule Leipzig\\\" is prominently displayed on the lower left, featuring an emblem that appears to be a ship or a symbol related to trade.
