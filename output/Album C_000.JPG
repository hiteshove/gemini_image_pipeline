The item is rectangular, appearing well-used and significantly aged. Its cover is a muted greyish-brown color, characterized by a distinct vertical ribbed texture, resembling corrugated cardstock or heavy paper. \\n\\nAlong the left edge of the cover, there is an embossed decorative border featuring a repeating pattern of stylized floral or scrollwork motifs. This left edge also shows considerable wear and tearing, revealing underlying layers of paper and the internal structure. A vibrant blue braided cord serves as a binding mechanism, threaded through the left side of the cover and tied into a knot, indicating a potentially handmade or self-bound construction.\\n\\nThe edges of the album are frayed and tattered, particularly the top and bottom, exposing darker, possibly black, paper layers beneath the main cover. In one of the closer views (Crop 3), faint yellowed lettering is visible on this darker underlying paper along the top edge, spelling out 'CORNELL', suggesting a potential affiliation, owner, or subject of the album. The overall condition suggests a long history of use and preservation, with visible creases, scuffs, and natural deterioration adding to its historical character.\",\n  \"tags\": [\n    \"vintage\",\n    \"album\",\n    \"portfolio\",\n    \"aged\",\n    \"worn\",\n    \"antique\",\n    \"paper\",\n    \"cardstock\",\n    \"ribbed texture\",\n    \"embossed\",\n    \"decorative border\",\n    \"blue cord\",\n    \"binding\",\n    \"historical document\",\n    \"keepsake\",\n    \"grey-brown\",\n    \"textile art\",\n    \"handmade\",\n    \"Cornell\"\n  ],\n  \"contextual_category\": \"Historical Documents & Objects\",\n  \"entities\": {\n    \"people\": [],\n    \"organizations\": [\n      {\n        \"name\": \"Cornell\",\n        \"type\": \"Educational Institution\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"locations\": [\n      {\n        \"name\": \"Cornell\",\n        \"type\": \"Unspecified (could be associated with institution or place)\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"date_estimate\": \"Early 20th Century\"\n  }\n}\n```"
